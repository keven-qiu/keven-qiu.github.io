            <h1>Keven Qiu</h1>
            <p>I am a current third year undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization.
                <br>
                <br>
                My main interests are in algorithms and in discrete mathematics, in particular combinatorial optimization and graph theoretic algorithms. I am also interested in machine learning and the mathematical theory underlying it.
            </p>
